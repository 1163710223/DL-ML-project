# convolutional-svm
This project use the convolutional neural networks method to extract the photo features which are the input for svm slassifying.
- Using ConvNets to extract features for SVM classifying
- This idea comes from the paper: Convolutional Clustering for Unsupervised Learning
- My blog about the understanding of this paper: http://blog.csdn.net/roguesir/article/details/72842958
